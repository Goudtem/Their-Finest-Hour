 ALB_italian_influence_desc:0 "The Treaty of Tirana, signed between ([ALB.GetFlag]) §Y[ALB.GetName]§! and ([ITA.GetFlag]) §Y[ITA.GetName]§!, is officially presented as a friendship and cooperation pact. On the surface, it brought much-needed financial support and military aid to ([ALB.GetFlag]) §Y[ALB.GetName]§!. In reality however, the treaty opened the door for [ITA.GetAdjective] influence to seep into every corner of ([ALB.GetFlag]) §Y[ALB.GetName]§!'s political and economic life. [ITA.GetAdjective] colonists have begun settling in key regions, and [2.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] has gained control over vital sectors like sugar production and dockyard operations. Diplomatically, ([ALB.GetFlag]) §Y[ALB.GetName]§! now faces increasing pressure to align with ([ITA.GetFlag]) §Y[ITA.GetName]§!'s interests, as political decisions are subtly directed from [2.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]."

 SOV_inner_party_democracy_desc:0 "Although legislative elections in the USSR are a sham, in that only one party is permitted to run, the Congress of Soviets nevertheless permits debate and independent thinking. This policy has resulted in the formation of three significant political factions within the party: the §RLeft§!, the §tCentre§!, and the §gRight§!.\n\nThe §RLeft Faction§!, led by §YLeon Trotsky§!, advocates for accelerated industrialisation, significant social reforms and the backing of communist movements across the globe.\n\nThe ruling §tCenter Faction§!, led by §YAlexei Rykov§!, advocates for progressive industrialisation, cautious social reforms and the preservation of the USSR's delicate global position.\n\nThe §gRight Faction§!, led by §YMikhail Tukhachevsky§!, supports increased military spending and a more assertive foreign policy, frequently failing to align its policies with the tenets of Marxist-Leninist doctrine."
